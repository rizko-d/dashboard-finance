## Mock Data

All data is stored in the `/src/services/api.js` file as asynchronous simulated-fetch functions. You can easily adapt it to use a real backend or API later.

---

## Customization

- To swap chart libraries (e.g., to Chart.js or ECharts), replace the chart components.
- To connect with your backend or change auth, adjust the services and API calls.
- Modify styling in `tailwind.config.js`.
